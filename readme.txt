Take complete control over the WordPress content editor.

== Description ==

= Description =

WP Edit is built around three years of custom WordPress development. WP Edit adds extensive, additional editing functionality to the default WordPress editor. Begin creating content like the pros; without knowing a single bit of HTML or CSS.

= ONLY Compatible with WordPress 3.9.1 and above =
* This plugin is intended for WordPress versions 3.9, and above.  
* DO NOT use this plugin on WordPress versions 3.8.3, and below. It will display eratic behavior.
* A LOT has changed. I HIGHLY suggest reading the following two articles BEFORE installating this plugin:
* ["WP Edit and WordPress 3.9"](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-edit-and-wordpress-39-please-read?replies=7)
* ["WordPress TinyMCE Editor"](http://learn.wpeditpro.com/wordpress-tinymce-editor/)
* Reading those before installing this plugin will save you time, guaranteed!

= The future of Ultimate Tinymce =
* This plugin is the successor of ["Ultimate Tinymce"](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-tinymce/).  
* It is a complete code rewrite.  A new admin panel has been created; new tabs and options; and increased code optimization.  
* This plugin has gone from a whopping 4 megabytes to an extremely lean 500k... WOW!

= Most Powerful Features =
WP Edit will provide new buttons, additional options, and extended formatting abilities to the exisiting content editor.

* Easily insert images, media, YouTube videos, and clip art.
* Create tables via a graphical interface.
* No need to learn HTML and CSS (although the basics can certainly help); use buttons with visual interfaces instead!
* Easily access all shortcodes available to your WordPress environment; and insert them into the content editor.
* Use shortcodes to insert columns.. similar to "magazine" style layouts, in your content areas.

= Why should you use this plugin? =
Because WP Edit is the culmination of three years development in the WordPress content editor. You can begin creating content (with advanced layouts); easily insert all types of external media (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.); adjust fonts, styles, colors, and sizes; and much more!

= What is included in the free version? =
* Drag and drop functionality for custom creation of the top row of editor buttons.
* Adds additional editor buttons such as subscript, superscript, insert media, emoticons, search and replace, html editor, preview.. and many more.
* Add your custom editor to excerpt areas and profile descriptions.
* Allow shortcodes in excerpt and widget areas.
* Highlight admin posts/pages based on status (green = published, yellow = draft, etc.)
* Easily import/export plugin options.

= Why should you upgrade to WP Edit Pro? =
* Drag and drop functionality for custom creation of all rows of editor buttons.
* Powerful network installation functionality; WP Network Ready.
* User roles for custom button arrangements; allow different user roles access to different editor buttons.
* Extreme Custom Widget Builder - create custom widgets just like posts or pages.. and insert them into any widget area or the content editor.

= Notes =
* This plugin is provided "as-is"; within the scope of WordPress.  We will update this plugin to remain secure, and to follow WP coding standards.
* If you prefer more "dedicated" support, with more advanced and powerful plugin features, please consider upgrading to ["WP Edit Pro"](http://wpeditpro.com).
