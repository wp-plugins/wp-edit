== Description ==

This plugin is intended for the new WordPress version 3.9.1.  DO NOT use this plugin on the current version of WordPress (3.8.2).  IT WILL BREAK.

This plugin is a successor of "Ultimate Tinymce".  
It is a complete code rewrite.  A new admin panel has been created; new tabs and options; and increased code optimization.  This plugin has gone from a whopping 4 megabytes to an extremely lean 500K... WOW!

I wanted to get this plugin hosted on the WordPress repository so that when the new version is released, I can make the transition as easy as possible.

This description will be updated when WordPress is updated to 3.9.1; currently scheduled for April 15th, 2014.

== Installation ==

Upload the `wp_edit` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

OR...

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= How do I get my options from Ultimate Tinymce converted to WP Edit? =

There is an option in WP Edit, under the "Database" tab, which will attempt to convert any options in the database to WP Edit.

== Changelog ==
