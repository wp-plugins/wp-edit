Take complete control over the WordPress content editor.

== Description ==

= Description =

WP Edit is built around three years of custom WordPress development. It is contstantly updated with new features (many from requests), and security enhancements. WP Edit adds extensive, additional editing functionality to the default WordPress editor.

= ONLY Compatible with WordPress 3.9.1 and above =
* This plugin is intended for WordPress versions 3.9, and above.  
* DO NOT use this plugin on WordPress versions 3.8.2, and below. Instead, please use ["Ultimate Tinymce"](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-tinymce/).

= The future of Ultimate Tinymce =
* This plugin is the successor of ["Ultimate Tinymce"](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-tinymce/).  
* It is a complete code rewrite.  A new admin panel has been created; new tabs and options; and increased code optimization.  
* This plugin has gone from a whopping 4 megabytes to an extremely lean 500k... WOW!

= Features =
WP Edit will provide new buttons, additional options, and extended formatting abilities to the exisiting content editor.

* Easily insert images, media, YouTube videos, and clip art.
* Create tables via a graphical interface.
* No need to learn HTML and CSS (although the basics can certainly help); use buttons with visual interfaces instead!
* Easily access all shortcodes available to your WordPress environment; and insert them into the content editor.
* Use shortcodes to insert columns.. similar to "magazine" style layouts, in your content areas.

There are many more features in WP Edit.. too many to list.  
Additionally, dedicated plugin support is provided via our ["Support Forum"](http://forum.wpeditpro.com/).
